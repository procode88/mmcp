I've worked with php frameworks like magento1, magento2, wordpress, woocommerce. I can use php, mysql, javascript, jquery, html, css, bootstrap, angularjs1, angularjs2, typescript, ionic framework


I want to find new opportunities and challenges to develop and improve myself


I always want to develop and improve myself. I want to be a world class programmer. I would stay on freeeup.com if that was the right place for me to develop


In the project for the site https://staging.walt-deko.de/ I wrote the extension 'print pdf catalog product' I could not do the print all products function in the categories and sub categories were as good as the customer request

I usually use skype and email to contact and communicate with customers

It is the spirit of learning and persevering
